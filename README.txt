Typing Game

A game to playfully work on your touch typing skills. 

This game is written in C# with Windows Forms. The game mechanics work well. Words are displayed on the screen and the player can type them to score points and level up for harder words. However the user interface could be a lot prettier. Development is moving to Windows Presentation Foundation (still using C#). See the Words of Life repository.
